Couple questions not to forget : 

How to properly use a wrapper ? What is it EXACTLY used for
Should header/footer be included inside ?

On the tablet design, the text oh the left "paragraph" is like overflowing on the image on the right. Is that something manageable in this setup ? 

I couldn't manage to get the space between the top and bottom section right. 
The height of the image was causing the grid height to be waaaay too big, and was pushing the bottom section quite afar, despite me moving the image. 
I had to "force" the grid height. How to avoid this ? 

I also had to cheat on the size of the pink-ish block of the bottom section, how to make sure it has the same size as the other divs, despite a quite smaller content ? 

Thanks to you all.
